                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future

                      threshold is enabled by default for dedicated clusters (M10+).
                      When disabled, MongoDB Cloud considers any operation that takes
                      longer than 100 milliseconds to be slow. Note: To use this attribute,
                      the requesting API Key must have the Project Owner role, if
