                      scale your analytics nodes in parallel to your operational nodes.
                      When configured as SEQUENTIAL, Atlas scales all nodes sequentially.
                      This mode is intended for steady-state workloads and applications
                      performing latency-sensitive secondary reads. When configured

                      This attribute has one object per shard representing node configurations

                      is configured with a value greater than 1 (using deprecated
                      sharding configurations), then each object represents a zone

This API resource accepts 1 through 50, inclusive. This parameter defaults to 1. If you specify a num_shards value of 1 and a cluster_type of SHARDED, Atlas deploys a single-shard sharded cluster. Don't create a sharded cluster with a single shard for production environments. Single-shard sharded clusters don't provide the same benefits as multi-shard configurations.
                            If you are upgrading a replica set to a sharded cluster, you cannot increase the number of shards in the same update request. You should wait until after the cluster has completed upgrading to sharded and you have reconnected all application clients to the MongoDB router before adding additional shards. Otherwise, your data might become inconsistent once MongoDB Cloud begins distributing data across shards.

                                        issues. Therefore, it should be used only
                                        with the Provisioned IOPS volume type. When

                                        will help avoid these issues.'

                      the BI Connector performs operations which may be CPU and memory

                      upgrade to an M30 or larger cluster or disable the BI Connector.

This API resource accepts 1 through 50, inclusive. This parameter defaults to 1. If you specify a num_shards value of 1 and a cluster_type of SHARDED, Atlas deploys a single-shard sharded cluster. Don't create a sharded cluster with a single shard for production environments. Single-shard sharded clusters don't provide the same benefits as multi-shard configurations.
                            If you are upgrading a replica set to a sharded cluster, you cannot increase the number of shards in the same update request. You should wait until after the cluster has completed upgrading to sharded and you have reconnected all application clients to the MongoDB router before adding additional shards. Otherwise, your data might become inconsistent once MongoDB Cloud begins distributing data across shards.

                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
                  through a Crossplane feature flag.
                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.

                      for Atlas (BI Connector) is only available for M10 and larger
                      clusters. The BI Connector is a powerful tool which provides
                      users SQL-based access to their MongoDB databases. As a result,
                      the BI Connector performs operations which may be CPU and memory
                      intensive. Given the limited hardware resources on M10 and M20

                      the cluster when enabling the BI Connector. If this occurs,
                      upgrade to an M30 or larger cluster or disable the BI Connector.

                      When configured as SEQUENTIAL, Atlas scales all nodes sequentially.
                      This mode is intended for steady-state workloads and applications
                      performing latency-sensitive secondary reads. When configured

This API resource accepts 1 through 50, inclusive. This parameter defaults to 1. If you specify a num_shards value of 1 and a cluster_type of SHARDED, Atlas deploys a single-shard sharded cluster. Don't create a sharded cluster with a single shard for production environments. Single-shard sharded clusters don't provide the same benefits as multi-shard configurations.
                            If you are upgrading a replica set to a sharded cluster, you cannot increase the number of shards in the same update request. You should wait until after the cluster has completed upgrading to sharded and you have reconnected all application clients to the MongoDB router before adding additional shards. Otherwise, your data might become inconsistent once MongoDB Cloud begins distributing data across shards.

                                        issues. Therefore, it should be used only
                                        with the Provisioned IOPS volume type. When
                                        using Provisioned IOPS, the disk_size_gb parameter
                                        specifies the storage capacity, but the IOPS
                                        are set independently. Ensuring that disk_size_gb
                                        is used exclusively with Provisioned IOPS
                                        will help avoid these issues.'
